## Motivation

Cryptocurrencies are a central part of Web3, enabling digital payments and programmable tokens for various roles in economic systems. However, the industry's lack of regulation and anonymity have led to concerns about cybercrime. Detecting and preventing fraudulent behaviors and malicious activities has become crucial. This tutorial aims to provide participants with practical knowledge in cryptocurrency data processing and network-building to enhance security and mitigate risks.

## Objectives

In this hands-on tutorial, participants will:

- Learn about cryptocurrency transaction and address profiling.
- Explore feature extraction for cryptocurrency transactions, focusing on attributes like address activity, transaction network characteristics, and asset transfer paths.
- Develop skills to detect fraudulent or malicious behaviors in cryptocurrency networks using case-based and intention discovery techniques.

The tutorial covers real-time monitoring and anomaly detection in cryptocurrency systems, offering hands-on exercises for academic researchers, industry practitioners, and data science enthusiasts.

## Tutorial Outline

### 1. Introduction
   - Overview of cryptocurrency addresses, transactions, and asset decentralization.
   - Tools and techniques for querying cryptocurrency data.

### 2. Feature Engineering
